# Entry CSV Export plugin for Movable Type

A plugin for Movable Type installations which provides a very basic
export-to-CSV functionality for entries/pages to facilitate easier review of
entry/page metadata.

* Enables full-fidelity export of entry/page data in CSV format for those
  entries/pages selected from the listing screen.
* Export selected Entries/Pages or all Entries/Pages in a given blog, or
  system-wide.

## Prerequisites

* Movable Type 6.1+
* Movable Type v4.3x, 5.x, 6.0.x are supported with version
  [1.0.3](https://github.com/endevver/mt-plugin-entry-csvexport/releases/tag/v1.0.3).

## Installation

Unzip the download archive. Move the resulting folder to `$MT_HOME/plugins/`
(where `$MT_HOME` is your MT or Melody application directory).

If you use Git, you can do the following:

    cd $MT_HOME/plugins
    git clone git@github.com:endevver/mt-plugin-entry-csvexport.git

## Configuration

There is no configuration for this plugin.

## Use

At the blog, website, or system level visit Manage > Entries or Manage > Pages.

Export selected Entries/Pages by placing checkmarks next to the items to
export, then from the "More actionsâ€¦" drop down select "Export as CSV" then
click "Go."

To export all Entries/Pages, click the checkbox in the listing header, which
will select all visible objects. A new row in the listing table will appear:
click "Select all xxx items," then choose "Export as CSV" from the "More
actions..." drop down and click "Go." Users of Movable Type 4.3x: choose "Export
this blog's entries (CSV)" from the Actions topic in the sidebar.

Depending upon the amount of data to export it could take a few minutes until
you are able to begin downloading the CSV file.
